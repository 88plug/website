## Lead

Akash is an open network that lets users buy and sell computing resources securely and efficiently, purpose-built for public utility.

## You will own your cloud, and you will be happy

With Akash, you have the power to own your cloud. You can deploy your own cloud infrastructure, and you can sell your unused cloud resources to others. You can also buy cloud resources from others, and you can use them to run your applications. 

Akash is community-owned and community-run. It is a public utility, and it is open source. It is a peer-to-peer network, and it is a marketplace. It is a cloud, and it is a supercomputer.

## Potential Headlines

### An open cloud is better to build on
