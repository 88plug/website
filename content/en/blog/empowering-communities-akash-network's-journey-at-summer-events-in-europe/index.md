# Empowering Communities: Akash Network's Journey through Inspiring Events

In the heart of technological advancement in both cloud and AI, the Akash Network has carved its path as a beacon of community-driven growth. With a commitment to fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and development, the network's community representatives recently embarked on an exhilarating journey through a series of impactful events in both Paris and Berlin. These gatherings not only showcased the immense potential of the Akash Network but also underscored the power of collective efforts in shaping the future of the Akash Network.

In this blog post, three Akash Insiders share their vantage point from attending AwesomeWasm, AtomBerlin, EthCC, SheFi Summit, Osmocon, Nebular Summit and many more events. They delve into the vibrant tapestry of events that these Akash Insiders had the privilege to attend, each contributing to the ongoing narrative of how Akash Network is redefining the way we interact, transact, and collaborate.

### **Rodri’s Event Notes**

**SheFI Summit** – I met Adam, Head of Community at Overclock Labs and Luna, follow Akash Insider, for the first time in real life. I enjoyed the talk about how decentralization could include having servers on a ship sailing in international waters.	

**CoOperate Paris** – I listened to talks about bringing offline assets on chains and how almost everything can be tokenized. 	I met Timo, from y2.finance he said they are building a fund and would be interested to purchase AKT if there is a discount opportunity somewhere.  I saw Greg chat about a possible offer/discount in the Akashians telegram group, so if there is such an opportunity, I have Timo’s contact. 

**FileCoin Unleashed** – I learnt about a protocol called Lilypad, which is leveraging Filecoin and working on creating smart contracts that can catch in game and on chain cheaters. I learnt that 	Filecoin is looking for GPUs for their network and spoke to Zach Ayesh from Filecoin and Protocol Labs, who gave a talk about this. He said that he would contact me if they want to use GPUs from Akash, but it seems that Filecoin is working on adding GPUs to their network via their own project, which I cannot remember the name of, but that was presented in one of the talks at the event too. They are still not in testnet and it is just a plan, so we are way ahead of them. 	

**NFT Pixel Party** – I beat Adam at Mario Kart and he owes me 1 million AKT. Had some drinks and met Mike from Archway. We spoke about the possibilities of their smart contracts and deploying directly on Akash. We have a call scheduled for next week to see how we can build something together. I met Nico who is building his own “on chain gambling” platform,I told him about how he could save money by running his platform on Akash and how there is no censorship on some providers, so he became interested. We exchanged Telegram and will reach out to him next week. 

**Cosmos On Y Va** – I got to speak on a panel titled “Usability affects mass adoption”. The moderator was Lisa from Secret and I spoke besides Swan from Evmos. I felt that the panel went okay and several people approached me afterwards. They were all interested in Akash, a validator from the Cosmos Hub showed me a picture of himself and Greg Osuri and told me that he will look into becoming a validator on Akash. Other developers approached me asking about pricing and several gamers came over to ask about how GPUs would be leased and about their price as well. I gave them my telegram and the Akash discord for when they want to deploy and if they need help. I met Dan Lynch from Cosmology, we spoke about his project and how it benefits onboarding new devs to Cosmos. 		

**Osmocon** - I listened to several talks at this event, including the new features that are coming to Osmosis, like mesh security, wrapped bitcoin and I was at Agoric’s presentation, where they described the benefits of decentralization and dedicated a few slides and minutes to Akash. I listened to some talks about the benefits of NFTs, gaming and I was also at the Cosmology talk. 	

I met the PostHuman validator team and they video interviewed me about Akash, their video will be online as soon as it is edited and I will share this interview with Akash Insiders and my social 	media. 			

I met with the Omniflix team and we talked about several deployments that they are running on my Akash provider and how they are planning to run more media content with GPU leases on Akash. 				

**Osmoscon After Party** - I met Lit from Notional team and he was interested in Akash economics. He agrees that we are one of the few blockchain projects that has an actual working product and he is looking forward to GPUs on mainnet, he said Jacob Gadikian is planning to lease some. 	I met the guy in charge of Osmosis' Twitter account and he thanked me for uploading videos and content from Osmocon. I met Liam “ex-Cosmos youtuber” he used to be with Strangeclan and used to do airdrop videos, but now he does not seem to be in any team anymore and was not very positive about Passage, Strangeclan or Akash, so I stopped talking to him. 			

**Secret On Chain Chaos** – I met Guy, founder of Secret Network. He told me some inside news and that there is an airdrop coming for a project called Linear. I also spoke to Lindsey who organized the Cosmos on Y Va event and Lisa the moderator for my panel. Met a few guys who did not know about Akash and are building their own projects, we connected via Telegram and I said I would help them deploy to Akash. 	

**Nebular Summit** – Went to several workshops and talks. 	 \




* I learnt about Lava and connected with Gil. Their network needs RPCs and they are interested in adding Akash, as well as decentralizing their providers. We promised to schedule a call for next week. Most of the nodes and infra they need can be run with Cosmos Omnibus repo. 			 \
 			
* I spoke with Sunny from Osmosis, Jack from Sommelier, Dan from 			Cosmology and Vladi from Posthuman and asked if they would be 			interested in judging the Akash-a-thon hackathon. They all said they are and I have already messaged them with the hackathon dates. (Fingers crossed) Vladi said that his team would also gladly create some video content promoting the hackathon on their channels. 			 \
 			
* I met Sarah, founder of Lum Network and Cosmos Millions. She said 			they are adding more Cosmos tokens to the Cosmos Millions platform 			and we spoke about the possibility of adding Akash. I think this would be a fun game to draw more people into Akash and/or create AKT holders, in my opinion better than Zealy. If you like this, I can schedule a call with her.

### **Joao's Event Notes**

**SheFi Summit **I was at SheFi as a Sponsor with Akash Network. The event was mainly focused on helping women be more engaged in the DeFi world. It welcomed women, non-binary and male allies to the event. It was a great warmup to ETH CC and crypto season in Paris. A lot of talks focused on Leadership, Community and Strategy. As a founder myself I resonated with much of what was said and took valuable lessons from all the empowered women that founded and helped founders achieve their visions. 

**EthCC Day One**

The first day of ETH CC was full of enthusiastic people and interesting talks. Walking the corridors you would hear talks about decentralization (and the urgent need Ethereum has for its nodes to be decentralized) as well as GPUs and AI. Letting people know about Akash and its decentralized Compute/GPU marketplace. 

**EthCC Day Two**

The second day of ETH CC was marked by Vitalik Buterin’s (the creator of Ethereum) presentation on the history of Account Abstraction. Went to a presentation about how ordering a decentralized blockchain is as easy as an AWS server with custom base tokens and fee models, control over who can transact and deploy contracts, and connected to other major blockchains, while remaining decentralized is no longer a dream. I was also able to demo Quasarch Cloud’s new under development cloud platform as well as how to use the Akash Network with the Console GUI. 

**Osmocon** 

Osmocon was by far the most energetic conference of this Crypto Paris Season. The atmosphere was great, the event was super well organized, the panels were interesting and fun and the booths were spot on! I was marked by the Mesh Security live demo which was a success and is on track to change the landscape of security in the blockchain. At the end of the day founders and builders took it to the ring. 

**EthGlobal Paris Day 1 **

At the start of ETH Global our team started to brainstorm some ideas. We knew we wanted to being something of value to the Akash Network and its decentralized cloud. We then decided to be very specific on the track that we wanted to follow, which led us to IPFS/Filecoin to try and integrate this decentralized storage network with Akash’s cloud compute marketplace. We then decided to build a backup agent for popular DBMS that could be run as a service on Akash or as part of a sidecar container on the Kubernetes Pod, that would backup data, encrypt it and store it on IPFS. We started to do this with Delta (enterprise grade IPFS/Filecoin solution, but as it was very recent it was also very unstable and buggy, so we decided to go with web3.storage instead. 

**EthGlobal Paris Day 2**

In the second day of ETH Global we focused on finishing our MVP that would support PostgreSQL backups. We setup everything automatically, from the Kubernetes cluster to the sidecar deployment. By the end of the day everything was ready for the demos. 

**EthGlobal Paris Day 3**

On the last day of ETH Global we pitched our solution to many judges that found the solution very interesting and received very positive feedback. We then went to see the prize delivery and closing notes on the successful Hackathon.

### **Damir's Event Notes**

A short reminisce on the Akash Community meetup in Berlin 2023

As you may already know my little self and zJ from the community pool were given the opportunity to meet in Berlin in July 2023 and attend ATOM Berlin and AwesomWasm events and represent the Akash and the community.

It was a fantastic experience, meeting zJ, his brother and Adam in real life gives so much more context to the dry text that we are used to communicating with and this is extremely important in order to create stronger bonds between the community members and the Akash core team. Meeting those people inspired me to do better, learn new stuff (I’m actually learning Rust just because I saw in real life how fun it is to do stuff with it) and has put a face and a person behind an internet entity. I think however cool and practical long-distance communication is, it just can’t beat face-to-face interaction. 

Attending the conferences always gives me more than I usually look for - from learning about writing smart contracts, to learning about new cool Cosmos projects, to meeting new people, random interactions that wouldn’t happen if I wasn’t actually there that takes everything to the next level. We got the chance to talk to the news reporters from an unknown portal (sorry I completely forgot to take their contacts) and give an interview spotlighting Akash. The interest in Akash was huge - everyone knew about Akash and we were treated with a lot of respect and a bit of awe - that’s how big Akash is in everyone’s minds.

Also, this was my first time visiting Berlin - I’ve been all over Germany but never actually Berlin - the city is something else, significantly different from other German cities. Now I see why the Confio people chose Berlin for the conference, it just fits perfectly into the Crypto scene.

I loved the experience and if I may selfishly self-promote - I’d love to go and represent Akash again! Next time with new knowledge and experience and bring even more value.

Thank you for letting me be a part of this.
